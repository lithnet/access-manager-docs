# Upgrading from Access Manager v1 to v3

There is no direct upgrade path available for migrating from Access Manager v1 to Access Manager v3. If you are still running v1, then you must first upgrade to v2, following the [update guidance](https://docs.lithnet.io/ams/v2.0/installation/upgrading-from-v1) for that version. Once you have migrated to v2, you can perform a [v2 to v3 update](upgrading-from-v2.md).
