# Access Manager Agent

## Prerequisites

In order to install the Access Manager Agent, the following prerequisites must be met

1. Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 or later
2. [.NET Framework Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 4.7.2 or later installed

We recommend using a configuration management tool such as SCCM to deploy the agent to your fleet.

## **Download and install the Access Manager Agent**

1. Download the latest version of the agent from the [releases](https://github.com/lithnet/access-manager/releases/latest) page. Take note that you must install the x64 version on 64-bit machines, and the x86 version on 32-bit machines.
2. Run the AMA installation package. Follow the prompts to install the application.

## **Configure the agent via Group Policy**

The Access Manager agent doesn't do anything until it's configured via a group policy. Follow the [password encryption and history setup guide](../../configuration/deploying\_features/setting-up-password-encryption-and-history.md) for the correct process of setting up the relevant group policy settings.
