Lithnet Access Manager comes in [two editions](access-manager-editions.md)

Standard edition is the core product that is free for all organizations to use. It allows organizations to build in-depth defenses against lateral movement-based attacks.

Enterprise edition contains features and functionality that support more advanced scenarios.

While Access Manager is in the beta phase, Enterprise edition licenses are built-in to each release. These licenses are valid for 90 days from the date of the release. An updated version will be provided approximately once per month, extending the license automatically for a further 90 days.

To discuss licensing or to obtain trial licenses, please email `support@lithnet.io`.
