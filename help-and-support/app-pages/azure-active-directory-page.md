## Tenant configuration

In order to support Entra-joined devices, you must configure Access Manager with access to your Microsoft Entra tenant. See the guide for [setting up the AMS directory](../../configuration/deploying-features/laps/setting-up-microsoft-laps-for-aad.md) for instructions on how to configure your tenant.
