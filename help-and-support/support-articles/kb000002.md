# KB000002: The Access Manager Service will not start in a failover cluster due to an incorrect databa

## Summary

When the Access Manager Service is installed in a failover cluster, the `Parameters` registry key cannot be modified unless the service is online. Any modifications made to this key while offline will be reverted as soon as the service starts. This causes a problem in the case the database connection string is no longer correct, as the service will fail to come online, and updates to the key are not possible.

## Cause

This is expected behavior for a service installed in a failover cluster.

## Resolution

### Step 1: Put the service into safe mode

Use the failover cluster manager to determine which node is currently hosting the AMS service. On that node, create the following registry value

```
Key: HKLM\Software\Lithnet\Access Manger Service
Name: SafeMode
Type: Dword
Value: 1
```

### Step 2: Bring the role online

Using the failover cluster manager, bring the service online on the node where you ran the command above. The service itself will start in a dormant mode.

### Step 3: Modify the connection string

Using the registry editor tool, navigate to `HKLM\Software\Lithnet\Access Manager Service\Parameters\ConnectionString` and provide the correct value

### Step 4: Delete the SafeMode registry key

Delete the `HKLM\Software\Lithnet\Access Manager Service\SafeMode` registry value created in step 1

### Step 4: Stop and start the role

Using the failover cluster manager, stop the role, and start it again. The service should now start correctly and connect to the database using the new connection string.
