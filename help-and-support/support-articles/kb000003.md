# KB000003: How to use the Access Manager Agent to manage the password for an account other than the root account on Linux

## Summary

The Access Manager Agent for Linux is configured by default to manage the password of an account named `root`. You can configure the agent to manage an account with a different name.

## Resolution

Modify the `/etc/LithnetAccessManagerAgent.conf` file to include the `Unix` and `Username` fields as shown below, replacing `adminuser` with your desired username. Be sure to match the braces, and provide the comma before the `Unix` element.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Trace",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "System.Net": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Unix": {
    "Username": "adminuser"
  }
}
```
