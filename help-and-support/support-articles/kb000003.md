# KB000003: How to use the Access Manager Agent to manage the password for an account other than the root account on Linux

## Summary

{% hint style="info" %}
Content on this pages applies only to agents running v2. 
Agents running v3 have native support for changing the account name in the policy configured on the AMS server
{% endhint %}

The Access Manager Agent for Linux is configured by default to manage the password of an account named `root`. You can configure the agent to manage an account with a different name.

## Resolution

Modify the `/etc/LithnetAccessManagerAgent.conf` file to include the `Unix` and `Username` fields as shown below, replacing `adminuser` with your desired username. Be sure to match the braces, and provide the comma before the `Unix` element.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Trace",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "System.Net": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Unix": {
    "Username": "adminuser"
  }
}
```

## Notes

The name of the account whose password is being managed is only visible to users in the web app when using Enterprise edition. Community edition users will be able to access the password, but the username will not be shown.
