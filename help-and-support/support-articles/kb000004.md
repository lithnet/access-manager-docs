# KB000004: How to create a log file to troubleshoot installation issues with the Access Manager Service

## Summary

If the Access Manager Service installer fails, you can use the in-built advanced logging capability to generate a detailed installation log of what happened, to help troubleshoot the root cause.

## Resolution

From an elevated command prompt, run the installer EXE with the following arguments

```batch
LithnetAccessMangerService-x64.exe /l*v C:\ams-install.log
```

A detailed log file will be created at the path specified, which can be used to help narrow down the root cause.
