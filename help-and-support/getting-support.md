# Getting Support

## Troubleshooting

If you are having a problem with your setup, or think you may have found a bug, we're here to help. We ask that you follow this process before logging a new issue.

Firstly, have a look at your [log files](troubleshooting.md). AMS has a very robust logging system and the reason for the problem may be clearly articulated in the log files.

Search through these help pages, and read the [Frequently asked questions](frequently-asked-questions.md) to see if your issue has already been addressed. Toy can also search through the [existing issues list](https://github.com/lithnet/access-manager/issues) to see if someone has had a similar problem to yours.

## Community edition users

Community edition users are supported through our GitHub community of specialists and fellow Access Manager users.

If you're unable to find your answer to your problem using the troubleshooting process described above, then you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/lithnet/access-manager/issues/new) in the GitHub issue tracker.

Please describe the problem in as much detail as possible. If you can, provide screenshots of the issue. Ensure you have captured the [log files](troubleshooting.md) from the time of the event. These logs may contain sensitive information about your environment, so don't upload them to the issue unless you are confident of their contents. If we need to see the log files, we will provide you an email address to send them to once your issue has been triaged.

## Enterprise edition customers

Enterprise edition customers can log their issues directly into the [Lithnet support system](https://lithnet.zendesk.com) using their assigned login details.
