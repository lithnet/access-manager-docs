# Getting Support

If you are having a problem with your setup, or think you may have found a bug, we're here to help. We ask that you follow this process before logging a new issue.

Firstly, have a look at your[ log files](troubleshooting.md). AMS has a very robust logging system and the reason for the problem may be clearly articulated in the log files.

Search through these help pages, and read the [Frequently asked questions ](frequently-asked-questions.md)to see if your issue has already been addressed. Search through the [existing issues](https://github.com/lithnet/access-manager/issues) to see if someone has had a similar problem to yours.

If you're unable to find an answer to your problem, then we ask that you raise a new issue here on Github. This helps us keep track of requests and to triage problems appropriately.

Please describe the problem in as much detail as possible. If you can, provide screen shots of the issue. Ensure you have captured the [log files](../docs/help/Troubleshooting/) from the time of the event. These logs may contain sensitive information about your environment, so don't upload them to the issue unless you are confident of their contents. If we need to see the log files, we will provide you an email address to send them to once your issue has been triaged.
