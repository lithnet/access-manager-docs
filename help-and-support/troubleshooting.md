# Troubleshooting

## Logs

The first step of any troubleshooting endeavor is check in the Access Manager log files. These contain information about errors and other important events.

## Access Manager Service

The Access Manager Service has two log files.

`access-manager-service.log` Contains events from the core access manager service, including diagnostic information on access requests and authorization results.

`access-manager-jitworker.log` Contains events from the JIT worker service, which is responsible for creating and deleting JIT groups for computer objects when this feature is enabled.

These logs are located in `%ProgramFiles%\Lithnet\Access Manager Service\Logs`

## Access Manager Agent

The Access Manager Agent log files are located in `%ProgramFiles%\Lithnet\Access Manager Agent\Logs`

## Configuration Tool

The configuration UI also has a log file to keep track of any issues encountered in the tool itself. The log file is called `access-manager-ui.log` and is located in `%ProgramFiles%\Lithnet\Access Manager Service\Logs`
