# Getting started with Windows LAPS and Lithnet Access Manager

Microsoft [recently announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/by-popular-demand-windows-laps-available-now/ba-p/3788747) that the new version of Windows LAPS has been released via Windows Update to Windows 10, 11, Windows Server 2019 and above! This is great news as it brings LAPS capability to all supported operating systems without needing any additional installation.

Windows LAPS replaces the 'legacy' LAPS that required manual installation, and is now built into the operating system itself. It has received some major new features including support for encrypting LAPS passwords, and storing a history of LAPS passwords.

What's even better is that Lithnet Access Manager works with the new Windows LAPS out of the box! You can combine the power of Windows LAPS with our web-based, mobile-friendly app, so your users can access your LAPS passwords with ease. Our app is MFA-ready with support for Azure AD and other OpenID Connect providers, and it has friendly, yet highly customizable auditing capability.

Windows LAPS and Lithnet Access Manager make the perfect pair ‚ù§.

In this guide, we'll show you how to get up and running with Access Manager and Windows LAPS. 

## Step 1: Prepare the Active Directory for Windows LAPS

Windows LAPS requires some new schema attributes and permissions to be delegated. Follow Microsoft's [setup guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-scenarios-windows-server-active-directory) for preparing your Active Directory to work with Microsoft LAPS. 

## Step 2: Enable and configure Windows LAPS
Make sure your test machines have installed the April 2023 Windows updates, which include the new LAPS capability.

Configure your LAPS clients via [group policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-management-policy-settings)

## Step 3: Test LAPS Access
Before configuring Access Manager, it's a good idea to make sure that LAPS is working natively first. You can use the built-in [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-scenarios-windows-server-active-directory#retrieve-a-password-from-windows-server-active-directory) modules to make sure you can access the LAPS passwords. Once you are confident that it is all working, you can move onto the next step of installing Access Manager.

## Step 4: Install Lithnet Access Manager Server
Now we can proceed with installing Access Manager itself. Our 
 [detailed setup guide](https://docs.lithnet.io/ams/installation/installing-the-access-manager-server/installing-the-access-manager-service) will walk you through the process.

For your test environment, use a single server deployment, with the built-in SQL Express engine, to simplify the deployment. 

## Step 5: Configure Access Manager to read LAPS passwords
Once Access Manager is installed, we need to grant it the permissions it needs to read passwords from the directory, and assign access to our users.

Follow the steps in the [configuration guide for Microsoft LAPS](https://docs.lithnet.io/ams/configuration/deploying-features/setting-up-microsoft-laps) to correctly delegate and assign user permissions.

## Step 6: Test user access
Visit the Access Manager web app in the browser and request the LAPS password for your test computer. If you have configured the app correctly, you should be presented with the LAPS password for the machine.
