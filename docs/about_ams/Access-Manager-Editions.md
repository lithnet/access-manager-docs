# Access Manager Editions

Access Manager comes in two editions - Standard and Enterprise.

## Standard Edition
Access Manager Standard edition is our core offering, that contains all the features that an organization need to help defend themselves from lateral movement-based attacks. You can provide your users full access to Microsoft LAPS passwords and request just-in-time admin access to computers all from the convenience of their browser.

Standard edition is completely free for any organization of any size to use.

## Enterprise Edition
Enterprise Edition is a must for organizations who want to take full advantage of the capabilities of Access Manager, and know they have the full backing of the Lithnet support team to help them keep their environment running smoothly.

See the [licensing](/app_pages/Licensing-Page) page for information on how to trial or purchase an Enterprise Edition license.
