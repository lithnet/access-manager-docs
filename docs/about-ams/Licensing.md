Lithnet Access Manager comes in [two editions](Access-Manager-Editions)

Community edition is the core product that is free for all organizations to use. It is community supported through our GitHub site, and allows organizations to build in-depth defenses against lateral movement-based attacks using existing technology such as Microsoft LAPS. 

Enterprise edition contains additional features and functionality, such as support for operating systems and scenarios that Microsoft LAPS doesn't support. It is a licensed product, that comes with enterprise support.
