## Schema
A list of forests is shown along with an indication of the deployment status of the Microsoft LAPS schema, and the Lithnet Access Manager schema.

You can use the `Deploy Schema...` button to access a script that will deploy the Lithnet Access Manager schema to the selected forest. You'll need to run this script as a member of the Schema Admins group in the forest you need to update.

If you need to deploy the Microsoft LAPS schema, refer to the [Microsoft guides](https://aka.ms/laps) on how to complete this process.

## Domain Permissions
In order for the Access Manager service to evaluate user permissions, its service account needs to be a member of two built-in groups of each domain. The first is the `Windows Authorization Access Group`. This allows the service account to compute the `tokenAndUniversalGroups` for a user in the directory. This ensures that the service account can see the user's full group membership.

The second group is the `Access Control Assistance Operators` group. This allows Access Manager to ask a domain controller in a trusting forest to perform access checks on its behalf. Membership in this group is not technically required in the domain and forest that the Access Manager Service runs in.

These groups provide read only access to authorization information within the domain.
