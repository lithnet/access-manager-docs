# Setting up Lithnet LAPS for Azure AD joined and registered devices
![](../images/badge-enterprise-edition-rocket.svg) Lithnet LAPS is an [Enterprise edition feature](/about-ams/Access-Manager-Editions)

Using the Lithnet Access Manager Agent to manage local admin passwords on devices requires some setup

If you are deploying the Access Manager Agent to domain-joined Windows devices, then you'll need to follow the steps in the [Lithnet LAPS for Active Directory setup guide](Setting-up-Lithnet-LAPS-for-Active-Directory).

If you are deploying the Access Manager Agent to devices that aren't joined to an Active Directory domain, you'll need to first [configure the Access Manager Directory](Setting-up-the-AMS-directory).

Once you've completed those steps, you can configure [Lithnet LAPS for the AMS directory](Setting-up-Lithnet-LAPS-for-the-AMS-directory)
