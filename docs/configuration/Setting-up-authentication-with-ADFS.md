# Setting up authentication with ADFS

The following guide will assist you in configuring your application to use Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) for authentication. 

## Part 1: Configure a new replying party trust in ADFS
1. Open the ADFS console, expand `Trust Relationships`, right-click `Relying Part Trusts` and select `Add relying-party trust`
2. Click `Next` and select `Enter data about the relying party manually`
3. Specify `Lithnet Access Manager` as the display name
4. Select `AD FS profile`
5. Skip the encryption certificate step
6. Check the box to `Enable support for the WS-Federation Passive protocol`. Specify the base URL where your Lithnet Access Manager is hosted (e.g. `https://accessmanager.lithnet.local/`)
7. Skip the page prompting you to add additional relying party trust identifiers
8. Optionally, configure multifactor authentication for the trust, and follow the remaining pages through to completion
9. Edit the claim rules for the application. Add a new issuance transform rule to `Send LDAP attributes as claims`
10. Set 'Issue UPN' as the claim rule name. Select `Active Directory` as the attribute store, `User-Principal-Name` as the `LDAP Attribute` and `UPN` as the outgoing claim type
